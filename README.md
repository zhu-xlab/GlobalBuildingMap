# GlobalBuildingMap

GlobalBuildingMap (GBM): the highest accuracy and highest resolution global building map ever created. GBM is derived from nearly 800,000 PlanetScope satellite images, and is distributed in the form of a binary raster (building and non-building) at a resolution of 3 meters.

Visual comparison of building footprints from different data sources in Cairo, Egypt. The three building footprint layers from GBM (purple), Google (cyan) and OSM (yellow) are overlaid with high-resolution aerial image. Two selected areas, i.e., dense area/informal
settlement (orange) and non-dense area (green) are zoomed in. Each area has three subfigures, which show the corresponding high-resolution aerial image as reference (left), GBM overlaid with satellite image (mid) and Google overlaid with satellite image (right). Background images Â© Google Maps.
